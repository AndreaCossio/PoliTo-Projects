## Exercise 01 - Word Count

Count word frequencies.

## Exercise 02 - Word Count 2-Gram

A word count can be seen as a special case of an ```n-gram``` count, where ```n``` is equal to 1. ```n-grams```, in our context, are sets of contiguous words of length ```n```. For example, in the sentence:
    
    She sells seashells by the seashore

```2-grams``` are:

    She sells
    sells seashells
    seashells by
    by the
    the seashore

Count ```2-grams``` frequencies.
